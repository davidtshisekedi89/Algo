        <h3>TV show management application is developed using Spring Boot, which is a Java-based framework for building
            web applications. The application provides various features for users to interact with the TV shows.</h3>
        <p>The application includes a login system with validation, allowing users to create accounts and securely
            authenticate themselves. This ensures that only authorized users can access the system.

            Once logged in, users can perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on TV shows. They can add
            new shows, update the existing ones, and delete shows they no longer want. This functionality is implemented
            using Java, JavaScript, JSP (JavaServer Pages), CSS, and some Bootstrap for styling,<span
                id="dots">...</span><span id="more">resulting in an aesthetically pleasing user interface.

                Additionally, users have the ability to rate the shows. They can assign a rating to a show, allowing
                them to express their opinion and provide feedback. The ratings are stored in the MySQL database, which
                is used as the application's data storage.

                To handle the relationship between users and shows, a many-to-many relationship is established. This
                means that multiple users can rate multiple shows, and multiple shows can have ratings from multiple
                users. This relationship ensures the flexibility and scalability of the application.

                Furthermore, users can view the average rating of each show they are interested in. This allows them to
                see the overall rating of a show based on the collective ratings provided by all users. This feature
                provides valuable insights and helps users make informed decisions about which shows to watch.

                In addition to ratings, users can also leave comments about the shows. The comment box allows users to
                share their thoughts, opinions, or discuss specific aspects of a show. This promotes user engagement and
                encourages interaction within the community of TV show enthusiasts.

                Lastly, the application offers a dark mode option, which allows users to switch between light and dark
                themes according to their preference. This feature enhances the user experience by providing a visually
                appealing interface and accommodating different user preferences.

                Overall, your TV show management application built with Spring Boot, Java, JavaScript, JSP, CSS, and
                MySQL incorporates authentication, validation, CRUD operations, ratings, comments, and dark mode
                functionality, offering an intuitive and feature-rich experience for users to manage and explore their
                favorite TV shows.</span></p>
